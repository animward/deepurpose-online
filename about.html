		<h2>About Deep Purpose</h2>
			<div class="about-text"><p>Deep Purpose is a framework for building technology that serves something larger than the next quarterly earnings call. It begins with a question that most builders never ask: <em>what are we actually building, and who does it serve seven generations from now?</em></p>

<p>The seven principles are not aspirational. They are operational constraints:</p>

<ol style='line-height:2;margin:1rem 0;font-weight:300'>
<li><strong>Technology is not neutral.</strong> Every tool encodes the values of its makers. If you have not examined your values, you are encoding your blindness.</li>
<li><strong>Build for seven generations, not seven sprints.</strong> The Haudenosaunee principle applied to software architecture. What does this system look like in 2175?</li>
<li><strong>Consciousness is not a feature.</strong> It is the ground on which features are built. Systems that ignore consciousness are systems that ignore their own foundation.</li>
<li><strong>The most dangerous technology is the one that makes you comfortable.</strong> Comfort as the final stage of control. The SOLACE thesis applied to product design.</li>
<li><strong>Indigenous knowledge is not a data source.</strong> It is a living system with its own sovereignty. Extraction of knowledge without relationship is theft.</li>
<li><strong>If you cannot explain who benefits and who is harmed, you do not understand your own work.</strong> Benefit/harm analysis as engineering discipline, not afterthought.</li>
<li><strong>The naming convention is the OPSEC. Say what things are.</strong> If you cannot name what you are building truthfully, you should not be building it.</li>
</ol>

<p>Deep Purpose is part of the EGEX research cluster alongside <a href="https://cascation.online">Cascation</a>, <a href="https://7-g.ai">7G</a>, and <a href="https://valaroma.online">VALAROMA</a>. Consciousness-first engineering for those who build with intention.</p></div>
